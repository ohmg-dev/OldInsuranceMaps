# Online Historical Map Georeferencer (OHMG)

OHMG is a web application that facilitates public participation in the process of georeferencing and mosaicking historical maps. Currently, a single implementation of this software exists, at OldInsuranceMaps.net, a platform based around the Sanborn Map Collection at the Library of Congress ([loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps](https://loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps)). More generic deployments are in the works.
