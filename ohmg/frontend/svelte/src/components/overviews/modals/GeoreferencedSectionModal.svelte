	<h3>Georeferenced</h3>
	<p>The <strong>Georeferenced</strong> section holds all content that has been spatially rectified, though you can still edit the control points for any layer whose georeferencing should be improved.</p>
	<p>Use the <strong>Classify Layers</strong> button to sort layers into different categories, if applicable. For example, if a Key Map is present, classify it here so other interfaces will treat it appropriately.</p>
